Abstract
Feature selection, as a dimensionality reduction technique, aims to choosing a small subset of the relevant features from the original
features by removing irrelevant, redundant or noisy features. Feature selection usually can lead to better learning performance, i.e.,higher learning accuracy, lower computational cost, and better model interpretability. Recently, researchers from computer vision, text
mining and so on have proposed a variety of feature selection algorithms and in terms of theory and experiment, show the e?ectiveness of
their works. This paper is aimed at reviewing the state of the art on these techniques. Furthermore, a thorough experiment is conductedto check if the use of feature selection can improve the performance of learning, considering some of the approaches mentioned in the
literature. The experimental results show that unsupervised feature selection algorithms bene?ts machine learning tasks improving the
performance of clustering.

1. Introduction
Recently, available data has increased explosively in both number of samples and dimensionality in many machine
learning applications such as text mining, computer vision and biomedical. In order to knowledge acquisition, it is im-
portant and necessary to study how to utilize these large scale data. Our interest focus mainly on the high dimensionalityof data. The huge number of high dimensional data has imposed signi?cantly big challenge on existing machine leaningmethods. Due to presence of noisy, redundant and irrelevant dimensions, they can not only make learning algorithms veryslow and even degenerate the performance of learning tasks, but also can lead to di ?culty on interpretability of model.
Feature selection are capable of choosing a small subset of relevant features from the original ones by removing noisy,
irrelevant and redundant features.
In terms of availability of label information, feature selection technique can be roughly classi?ed into three families:
supervised methods [1, 2, 3, 4], semi-supervised methods [5, 6, 7], and unsupervised methods [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. The
availability of label information allows supervised feature selection algorithms to e ?ectively select discriminative and
relevant features to distinguish samples from di?erent classes. Some supervised methods have been proposed and studied[3, 13]. When a small portion of data is labeled, we can utilize semi-supervised feature selection which can take advantageof both labeled data and unlabeled data. Most of the existing semi-supervised feature selection algorithms [5, 14] rely onthe construction of the similarity matrix and select those features that best ?t the similarity matrix. Due to the absenceof labels that are used for guiding the search for discriminative features, unsupervised feature selection is considered as amuch harder problem [9]. In order to attain the goal of feature selection, several criteria have been proposed to evaluatefeature relevance [2, 15].

Based on the di?erent strategies of searching, feature selection can also be classi?ed into three methods, i.e., ?lter
methods, wrapper methods and embedded methods. Filter methods select the most discriminative features through the
character of data. Generally, ?lter methods perform feature selection before classi?cation and clustering tasks and usuallyfall into a two-step strategy. First, all features are ranked according to certain criteria. Then, the features with the highestrankings are selected. Many ?lter-type methods have been used, including reliefF [16, 17], F-statistic [18], mRMR [19]
and information gain [17]. Wrapper methods use the intended learning algorithm itself to evaluate the features. Thework [20] utilizes Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the mostrelevant gene to cancers. Embedded models perform feature selection in the process of model construction. Figure 1 showsthe classi?cation of feature selection methods.

Sparsity regularization recently is very important to make the model learned robust in machine learning and recently
has been applied to feature selection. l1-SVM method [21, 22] based on l1-norm regularization has been proposed to
perform feature selection. The work [23] used logistic regression with l1norm regularization for feature selection. By
combiningl1-norm andl2-norm, Hybrid Huberized SVM (HHSVM), a more structured regularization, has been proposed
in [24]. The authors in [25, 26] developed a model with l2,1-norm regularization to select features shared by multi tasks.
The work [3] employed a joint l2,1-norm minimization on both loss function and regularization.
The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related work. The state of the art feature selection
algorithms are introduced in Section 3. In section 4, we conduct extensive experiments and report experimental results.Finally, we provide the conclusions in section 5.
2. Related work
Supervised feature selection approaches are for those data which are labeled. Traditional supervised methods such
as Fisher Score [27] rank features individually according to the criterion, which can not consider the correlation among
di?erent features. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA for short) [28] was proposed to elevate features by maximizing the
ratio between the class scatter and within class scatter. Unfortunately, LDA su?ers from the small sample size problem
because it needs to calculate the inverse matrix of within class scatter, which is singular when the number of trainingsamples is smaller than the dimensionality of the data [29]. To avoid this problem, maximum margin criterion(MMC forshort) based algorithm is proposed in [30], which uses a linear combination of traces between class scatter and within classscatter in the objective function and introduces a constraint of orthogonal weight matrix. However, all supervised methodshave the common limitation of the requirement of su?cient labeled data, which is very expensive to obtain in practice. The
performances of such supervised methods, however, usually drop dramatically when the labeled training data are scarce[31].
Semi-supervised feature selections, by contrast, exploit not only labeled but also unlabeled training data. As a result,
semi-supervised methods are able to select features by utilizing unlabeled data when there is limited number of labeled
data. Among others, graph Laplacian based semi-supervised methods assumes that most data examples lie on a low-dimensional manifold, such as semi-supervised Discriminant Analysis (SDA) [32]. In graph Laplacian based methods,graph Laplacian matrix is introduced to harness the unlabeled samples. However, they are usually less e?cient on handling
large-scale data because of the time-consuming computation of the graph [33]. Therefore, it is necessary and important tostudy unsupervised feature selection.
Due to the absence of label information that is used for guiding the search for discriminative features, unsupervised
feature selection is considered as a much harder problem [9]. Many researchers have proposed some criterions to de?nefeature relevance. One commonly used criterion is choosing those features that can best preserve the manifold structureof the original data. Another frequently used method is to seek cluster indicators through clustering algorithms and then921  Jianyu Miao and Lingfeng Niu  /  Procedia Computer Science   91  ( 2016 )  919 ñ 926 
transform the unsupervised feature selection into a supervised framework. There are two di?erent ways to use this method.
One way is to seek cluster indicators(considered as pseudo labels) and simultaneously perform the supervised feature
selection within one uni?ed framework. The works [10] and [34] integrated nonnegative spectral cluster and structurallearning into a joint framework. Another ?rst seeks cluster indicators, then perform feature selection to remove or selectcertain features, and ?nally to repeat these two steps iteratively until certain criteria is met. The authors in [8] ?rst usespectral analysis to obtain indicator matrix of data points, then use indicator matrix to perform feature selection likesupervised one.
3. Algorithms
Before going to introduce the state of the art feature selection algorithms, we would like to give some notations to be
used in our paper. We assume that we have ndata pointsX={x
i}n
i=1and each xihas dfeatures{f1,f2,∑∑∑,fd}. And we
use Xto denote as data matrix. Given a square matrix A, the trace of Ais the sum of the diagonal elements of A. And the
Frobenius norm of A?Rm◊nis given by
?A?F=?vm?
i=1n?
j=1A2
ij
Following the previous work [35], we give l2,1norm of the matrix A?Rm◊n
?A?2,1=m?
i=1?vn?
j=1A2
ij=m?
i=1?ai?2
where aiis the i-th row of Aand?∑? 2is Euclidean norm. The a?nity matrix is de?ned as follows
Sij=???????exp(-?xi-xj?2
s2)xi?N k(xj)o r xj?N k(x)i)
0 otherise
which can be used to exploit the local data structure of data points, where Nk(xj) denotes the set of knearest neighbors of
xi. Following [36], the normalized Graph Laplacian matrix is de?ned as L=D-1/2(D-S)D-1/2, where Dis a diagonal
matrix, whose the i-th diagonal element is the sum of the i-th column of S, i.e., Dii=?
jSij.
Relief [16] and its multi-class extension ReliefF [37] are supervised feature weighting algorithms of the ?lter model.
Assuming that pinstances are randomly sampled from data, for the case where there are two classes, the evaluation criterion
of Relief is de?ned as
SC(fi)=1
2p?
t=1d(ft,i-fNM(xt),i)-d(ft,i-fNH(xt),i) (1)
where ft,idenotes the value of sample xton feature fi,fNM(xt),iand fNH(xt),idenote the values on the i-th feature of the
nearest points to xtwith the same and di?erent class label, respectively. d(∑) is a distance measurement. To handle multi-
class problems, the above criterion Eq.(1) can be extended to the following formulation:
SC(fi)=1
pp?
t=1?????????-1
mxt?
xj?NH(xt)d(ft,i-fj,i)+?
y/nequaly xt1
mxt,yP(y)

xj?NM(xt,y)d(ft,i-fj,i)?????????(2)
where y
xtis the class label of the instance xtand P(y) is the probability of an instance being from the class y.NH(x) and
NM(x,y) denote a set of nearest points to x with the same class of xa n dad i?erent class (the class y), respectively. mxtand
mxt;yare the sizes of the sets NH(x) and NM(x,y), respectively. Usually, the size of both NH(x) and NM(x,y),?y/nequalyxt,i s
set to a prespeci?ed constant k. The evaluation criteria of Relief and ReliefF suggest that the two algorithms select features
contributing to the separation of samples from di?erent classes.
Laplacian Score was proposed in [15] to select features that can retain sample locality speci?ed by an a?nity matrix K.
Given K, its corresponding degree matrix Dand Laplacian matrix Lare obtained. Then the Laplacian Score of a feature f
is calculated in the following way:
LS=àfTLàf
àfDàf,where àf=f-fTD1
1TD1(3)
where 1 is a vector of the same size with vector f. Since features are evaluated independently in Laplacian Score, selecting
kfeatures with Laplacian Score can be achieved by greedily picking the top kfeatures which have the minimal LSvalues.922   Jianyu Miao and Lingfeng Niu  /  Procedia Computer Science   91  ( 2016 )  919 ñ 926 
Proposed in [2], SPEC is an extension of Laplacian Score. In SPEC, given the a?nity matrix K, the degree matrix
D, and the normalized Laplacian matrix L, three evaluation criteria are proposed for weighting feature relevance in the
following ways:
SC 1(fi)=òfT
i?(L)òfi=n?
j=1a2
j?(?j) (4a)
SC 2(fi)=òfT
i?(L)òfi
1-(òfT
i?1)2=?n
j=2a2
j?(?j)
?n
j=2a2
j(4b)
SC 3(fi)=k?
j=1(?(2)-?(?j))a2
j (4c)
where àfi=(D1
2fi)∑?D1
2fi)?-1,(?(j),?(j) is the j-th eigenvalue and the eigenvector pair of L.aj=cos?j, where?jis the
angle between àfiand?j; and?(∑) is an increasing function which is used to re-scale the eigenvalues of Lfor denoising. The
top eigenvectors of Lare the optimal soft cluster indicators of the data [36]. By comparing with these eigenvectors, SPEC
selects features that assign similar values to instances that are similar according to K. In [2], it is shown that Laplacian
Score is a special case of the second criterion, SC 2de?ned in SPEC. Note that SPEC also evaluates features independently.
SPFS [38] performs feature selection by preserving sample similarity, which can handle feature redundancy. The
problem can be formulated by:
min
?W? 2,1=?n?
i,j=1(xT
iWWTxj-Sij)2(5)
Here?>0 is a hyper-parameter.
MCFS [8] adopt a two-step strategy to select those features such that the multi-cluster structure of data can be best
preserved. To be speci?c, ?rstly, cluster indicator can be obtained through spectral clustering(problem (6a)), then use the
indicator matrix to perform feature selection(problem (6b)). Consider the two following optimization problem:
min
FTF=ITr(FTLF) (6a)
min
wi?fi-XTwi?+ﬂ?w i?1 (6b)
where?wi?1is thel1norm of wi. Since the formulation only involves a sparse eigen-problem and a L1regularized least
squares problem, problem (6) can be e?ciently.
Under the assumption that the class label of input data can be predicted by a linear classi?er, UDFS [10] incorporated
discriminative analysis and l2,1-norm minimization into a joint framework for unsupervised feature selection. Feature
selection can be performed by optimizing the following problem
min
WTW=ITr(WTXLXTW)+ﬂ?W?2,1 (7)
whereﬂ=0 is a regularization parameter.
NDFS [39] performs spectral clustering to learn the cluster labels of the input samples, during which the feature
selection is performed simultaneously. The joint learning of the cluster labels and feature selection matrix enables NDFS
to select the most discriminative features. To learn more accurate cluster labels, a nonnegative constraint is explicitlyimposed to the class indicators. Its formulation is presented as follows
min
W,FTr(TTLF)+a?F-XTW?2
F+ﬂ?W?2,1
s.t.FTF=I,F=0(8)
wherea=0 andﬂ=0 are balance parameters. Due to the presence of orthogonal constraint, optimization of problem (8)
is di?cult. NDFS use the idea of penalty function to solve the formulation.
Matrix factorization has been proven to be e?ective to perform feature selection. EUFS [40] embeds feature selection
into a clustering algorithm via sparse learning without transformation. The problem can be formulated as
min
U,V?X-UVT?2,1+a?V?2,1+ﬂTr( UTLU)
s.t.UTU=I,U=0(9)
wherea=0 andﬂ=0 are balance parameters. l2,1norm is applied to cost function to reduce the e?ect of noise and
outliers. In order to obtain more sparse solution, l2,1regularization has been used. The authors in [40] has developed a
novel iterative method called Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM for short) to optimize problem (9).923  Jianyu Miao and Lingfeng Niu  /  Procedia Computer Science   91  ( 2016 )  919 ñ 926 
4. Experiments
Due to the space limitation of paper, in this section, we conduct extensive experiments only for unsupervised feature
selection. In our experiments, we used 12 publicly available data sets.
4.1. Datasets
The experiments are conducted on 12 publicly available datasets, including ?ve image datasets (PIX10P, PIE10P,
COIL20, ORL and JAFFE), two handwritten digit datasets (MNISIT and BA), two text datasets (tr11 and oh15), three
microarray datasets (TOX-171, Tumors9 and Leukemia1). Table 1 summarizes the statistics of these data sets.

4.2. Compared Algorithms
In our experiment, the state of the art unsupervised feature selection methods mentioned above have been considered.
we list them as follows:
All Features: Using all features perform clustering
MaxVar: Features corresponding to the maximum variance are selected to clusterLaplacian Score [15]: Features consistent with Gaussian Laplacian matrix are selected to best preserve the local manifold
structureSPEC [2]: Features are selected using spectral regression
SPFS-SFS [38]: The traditional forward search strategy is utilized for similarity preserving feature selection in the SPFS
frameworkMCFS [8]: Features are selected based on spectral analysis and sparse regression problem
UDFS [10]: Features are selected by a joint framework of discriminative analysis and l
2,1norm minimization
NDFS [39]: Discriminative features are selected by a joint framework of nonnegative spectral analysis and linear regres-
sion withl2,1norm regularization
EUFS [40]: Unsupervised feature selection which embeds feature selection into a clustering algorithm via sparse learning
without transformation.
4.3. Experiment setting
Since most of feature selection algorithms selected in experiment have one or more parameters, we have to set them
before conducting experiments. In order to fairly compare with each other, we choose the best result from several di?erentparameters setting for each algorithm. In this subsection, we give parameters setting used in these algorithms. Based on
[34], for Laplacian Score, SPEC, SPFS-SFS, MCFS, UDFS, NDFS and EUFS, we would like to ?x the neighborhood size
Kto be 5 for all data sets. To ?nd the best clustering results for these algorithms, a well-known technique called grid-search
strategy can be used, where the parameters range from {10
-8,10-6,..., 106,108}. In experiments, we also need to specify
the number of selected features. It is not realistic to know the optimal number of features . we empirically choose the
number of selected features from {50,100, 150, 200, 250, 300}. Based on the selected features, We use K-means algorithm
to cluster the data points into cgroups. Because the initial center points have great impact on performance of K-means
algorithm, we conduct K-means algorithm 20 times repeatedly with random initialization. Then, we report the averageresults with standard deviation.
4.4. Evaluation Metrics
There are two commonly used metrics which can be used to evaluate performance of clustering. They are clustering
accuracy(ACC for short) and normalized mutual information(NMI for short). Generally speaking, the larger ACC and NMI
are, the better performance of clustering is. We present the concrete mathematical formulations as below.924   Jianyu Miao and Lingfeng Niu  /  Procedia Computer Science   91  ( 2016 )  919 ñ 926 
Clustering Accuracy(Acc): Like classi?cation accuracy, we can compare the label obtained from clustering with true
label to get clustering accuracy.
Acc=n?
i=1d(map(l i),yi)
n
where liand yiare the cluster label and true class label of xi, respectively, nis the total number of data points, d(x,y)
is the delta function that equals 1 if x=yand equals 0 otherwise, and map(l i) is the permutation mapping function
that maps each cluster label rito equivalent label from data set.
Normalized Mutual Information(NMI): NMI can be used to evaluate the quality of clusters. Now given a clustering
result, the NMI can be calculated with the following formulation
NMI=c?
i=1c?
j=1nijlognij
niànj
v
(c?
i=1nilogni
n)(c?
j=1ànjlogànj
n)
where niand à njdenote the number of contained in the cluster Ciand class Ljfori=1,2..., c,j=1,2..., c,
respectively, and nijis the number of data that are in the intersection between cluster Ciand class Lj.
4.5. Experiment Results
We give the clustering results of di?erent methods on the 12 real life datasets in Table 2(ACC) and Table 3(NMI).
The results include the average and the standard deviation of clustering accuracy and normalized mutual information,
respectively. From the two tables, we can make the following several observations. First, feature selection is necessary ande?ective. It can not only signi?cantly reduce the numbers of feature and make machine learning algorithms more e?cient,but also can improve the performance. Secondly, in general, almost no one feature selection method can obtain the bestresult on all data sets.

5. Conclusions
This paper gives a survey on feature selection methods proposed in literature. Several state of the art feature selection
methods are introduced. As we can see in our experiments, there are one or more parameters to be set. However, in
practice, we do not and can not know the best parameters corresponding to the given data set. So How to select theadaptive hyper-parameters and the number of selected features are open problems and also are our future work.
